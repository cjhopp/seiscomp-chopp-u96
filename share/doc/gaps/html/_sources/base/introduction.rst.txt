Introduction
============

|product| provides modules for interacting with a |scname| system by web browser.
It ships with a server and highly interactive modern web applications to monitor
seismic activity and to show real time data of your network or monitor station
quality. Event information is accessed in real-time and from archive via
:cite:t:`quakelink`. QuakeLink is therefore provided along with |product|.

|product| is optimized for multiple users, security and high load. It serves
static files in formats like CSS, HTML, JS and exposes an Ajax API to receive
|scname| objects like picks, quality parameters as well as data records in real
time. |product| complements QuakeLink to build interactive and responsive web
applications for |scname|.

Herein, we discriminate between

* |product| as the name of the gempa software product and
* |appname| for the module which provides the server and the web frontends and
  which can be configured and started within a |scname| system.

For requirements, installation and configuration of |appname| start reading the
section :ref:`gaps_overview` but for a user tutorial read the section
:ref:`gaps_client_modules`.
