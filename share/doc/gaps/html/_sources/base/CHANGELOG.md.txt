## 2023.178

### Added

-   Add optional event region per widget. This can be useful if the
    events per widget should cover a larger region than the initial
    widget bounds.

    ```
    # Use a different event region than the initial map region
    apps.eqview.widget.abc.eventRegion = 20x40+45-8
    ```

## 2023.174

### Added

-   Add EQ symbol animation type "three-circles" which animates
    the current earthquake symbol in three steps: one circle,
    two circles, three circles:

    ```
    apps.eventSymbolAnimation = three-circles
    ```

## 2023.173

### Added

-   Add configuration parameter to toggle display of map zoom
    controls in v2 web applications:

    ```
    apps.mapShowZoomControl = true
    ```

-   Add default station cluster setting for v2 traceview:

    ```
    apps.traceview.cluster = true
    ```

## 2023.166

### Added

-   Support event color scale based on magnitude:

    ```
    apps.colorMode = magnitude
    ```

-   Use `scheme.maps.originSymbolMinSize` to configure
    the fixed size of event symbols if the color mode
    is "magnitude".
-   Add single event mode to eqview v2 which shows the
    selected event exclusively.

    ```
    apps.eqview.singleEventMode = true
    ```

-   Show stations in eqview v2 optionally and allow to
    configure station colors per type.

    scheme.colors.stationTypes = BB:orange, SM:blue, SP:lightgreen
    ```

## 2023.158

### Fixed

-   Fix setting configured mode in stationview (v2)

### Added

-   Add forwarding of SeisComP `scheme.precision` values
    to web apps v2. To restore the current precision display,
    the following values have to be configured in `gaps.cfg`:

    ```
    scheme {
      precision {
        depth = 0
        distance = 1
        location = 1
        magnitude = 1
        originTime = 0
        pickTime = 1
        traceValues = 1
        rms = 1
        uncertainties = 1
      }
      map {
        stationSize = 25
      }
    }
    ```

-   Add configuration to set the station shape:

    ```
    scheme.map.stationSymbol = hexagon | triangle | diamond
    ```

    This is only recognized with web apps v2.

## 2023.157

-   Fix lat/lon/mag display in web apps version 2
-   Add `widget.maximumMagnitude` filter and add support for it to
    web apps version 2

    <http://localhost:8080/traceview/#/?stations=GR.WET,CZ.KHC>

## 2023.104

-   Update event processors input CSV description. Five additional fm columns
    have been added.

    to control ground motion amplitude computation.

## 2022.298

### Changed

-   Update SQLite library to 3.39.4 to fixing CVE-2022-35737.

## 2022-07-29

### Fixed

-   Apply mapMaxLevel to base layer
-   eqview widgets for undefined minimum magnitude threshold
-   Tile layer config debug output
-   Tile layer contains test

## 2022-07-28

    `apps.traceview.forceHTTP`.
-   Respect forceHTTP setting in traceview@v2.

## 2022-07-13

### Fixed

-   Support environment variables with `tileLayers.*.db`

## 2022-07-11

### Added

-   Added additional tile layer configuration. In order to provide higher detailed
    maps in certain areas it is now possible to define a mbtiles database for
    particular zoom levels and bounding rects. An example configuration looks like
    this:

    ```
    tileLayers = myarea
    tileLayers.myarea {
        db = /path/to/map.mbtiles
        levels = 11:16
        rects = +2048+2048+2064+2064
    }
    ```

## 2022-05-17

### Changed

-   Update documentation on installation and setup

## 2022-04-28

### Added

-   Allow configuration of event age color scale with `scheme.colors.originSymbol.age.gradient`.
    This setting will currently be only used by frontends in version 2 and later.

## 2022-04-27

### Added

-   Fetch event type list and event type certainty list from server

## 2022-04-26

### Fixed

-   Read spatial vector data from standard vector directory of the corresponding
    SeisComP release

## 2022-04-25

### Changed

-   Renamed the v1 frontend assets directory `static` to `assets`
-   OriginLocatorView fetches known event types from backend and presents
    a sorted list
-   Frontends v2 do respect `colorByAge` settings.

### Fixed

-   v1 frontends used a wrong maximum age value of 210 days instead of
    1 month. This has been fixed. All events older than 30 days are
    being rendered in gray now.

## 2022-04-14

### Added

-   Add install instructions for basic setup and web server integration

### Fixed

-   Typos and default values in description XML

## 2022-03-17

### Added

-   Added landing page for frontends v2. To configure it use

    ```
    indexTemplate = @DATADIR@/gaps/index-v2.cs
    ```

## 2022-02-23

### Fixed

-   Fixed typo in description: showWidgetsBounds -> showWidgetBounds

## 2022-02-21

### Fixed

-   Fixed display of region bound rectangle. Due to a regression the initial
    map region bound in eqview was always shown and not the widget region bounds.
    As both behaviors are desirable, an additional configuration option has been
    introduced: `apps.eqview.showWidgetBounds`. To enable the old behavior, set

    ```
    apps.eqview.showWidgetBounds = true
    ```

    which takes precedence over `apps.eqview.showRegionBounds`.

## 2022-01-10

### Changed

-   Add reasonable ITAPER() to default filters for optimizing data filtering
-   Update documentation

## 2021-10-07

### Changed

-   Update AngularJS to 1.8.2 and JQuery to 2.2.4 for the 1st generation web
    applications

## 2021-05-20

### Fixed

-   Only center at the latest earthquake initially in StationView if earthquakes
    should be shown

## 2020-11-19

### Fixed

-   Fix redirection to index.html

## 2020-09-30

### Fixed

-   Fix OriginLocatorView settings input fields which were not applied correctly
    on change.

## 2020-09-15

### Fixed

-   Fix handling of empty server responses in Web applications. This is important
    for QuakeLink servers which are configured with a long poll timeout.

## 2019-09-24

### Changed

-   Remove tile db configuration from default configuration in order that the
    global configuration is not overridden by default. This change might break
    existing installations that does not set
    the **tileDB** parameter in the configuration file explicitly. To fix the
    issue add the following line to the GAPS configuration.

    ```
    tileDB = @DATADIR@/gaps/zoom12.mbtiles
    ```

    Alternatively, the map location can be also defined in the global or GAPS
    configuration file with

    ```
    map.location = @DATADIR@/gaps/zoom12.mbtiles
    ```

## 2019-04-26

### Added

## 2019-01-24

### Fixed

-   Fixed ITAPER() filter which caused invalid data

## 2019-01-22

### Fixed

-   Fixed map centering in OriginLocatorView. Sometimes the map is centered 360
    degrees left of the event or right of it so that it looks like the event is
    not shown at all.

## 2019-01-15

### Added

-   Added configurable reference place to which the distance and azimuth of the
    currently selected event is calculated and shown in the details

## 2018-12-21

### Added

### Added

-   Added options to play audio alert and give visual feedback if a new event
    has been set as latest event for a widget

## 2018-12-13

### Added

-   Added option to hide the latest event panel and to show the latest overall
    event above the widgets

## 2018-12-12

### Added

-   Added option to either use event depth or event age as source for symbol colors

### Fixed

-   Fixed symbol (either station or event) placement. They are now being placed
    as close as possible to the center of the configured region

## 2018-11-30

### Fixed

-   Fixed epoch matching in web application when station are being added to the
    map

## 2018-08-14

    deactivated

## 2018-04-30

### Added

-   If an event in EQView is selected manually, the URL will change to a
    permanent link

## 2018-04-19

### Changed

-   Upgraded critical external web components to latest version

## 2018-04-05

### Fixed

-   Report correct content-type for URL directories, e.g. localhost/stationview/.
    Not reporting it prevents Google Chrome from rendering the page.

## 2018-03-07

### Fixed

-   Fixed connection state in StationView which was shown always as disconnected
    once a connection to QuakeLink returned with an error even after a reconnect.

## 2018-03-05

### Fixed

-   If the maximum bound rectangle is given (`apps.mapRegion.*`) then station
    symbols are placed in the map that way that they are inside this rectangle.
    E.g., setting the rectangle's longitude range from 0 to 360 will center the
    map at 180 degrees and add station symbols left and right of the date line.

## 2018-02-26

### Added

-   Added EQView configuration parameter `apps.eqview.externalData` which
    allows to show external (with respect to the local inventory) referenced
    waveform data. This parameter is by default `true`. If set set to `false`
    then only stations which are part of the local inventory, which have bindings
    and which are associated with the shown event will be added to the list of
    traces.

## 2018-02-20

### Fixed

-   Fixed waveform acquisition over HTTP which sometimes resulted in an interrupted
    data stream. Although the stream recovered by requesting the data again, the
    behavior was caused by a bug.

## 2018-01-31

### Fixed

-   Finally we changed the EQView carousel screenshot thanks to Péter Mónus who
    discovered the fail

## 2017-09-06

    apps.scolv.picker.preOffset = 30
    apps.scolv.picker.postOffset = 60
    ```

-   Added OriginLocatorView settings tab to control some picker time window
    settings. More probably to come.

## 2017-04-18

### Fixed

-   Fixed legend style bug that showed up in Webkit browsers (Chrome/Chromium)
    when the page is zoomed to a particular level

## 2017-03-27

    ```
    apps.scolv.ttt = libtau, LOCSAT
    apps.scolv.ttt.libtau.models = iasp91, ak135
    apps.scolv.ttt.LOCSAT.models = iasp91, tab, custom1, custom2
    ```

## 2017-02-10

### Added

-   GAPS requires now station bindings to enable station inventory and configuration
    for web applications. Unbound stations will not be shown in e.g. StationView.

## 2017-02-03
