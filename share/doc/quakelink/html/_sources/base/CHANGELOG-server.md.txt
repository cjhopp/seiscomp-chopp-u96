    brower.

## 2020-09-15

### Added

-   Option to configure long polling timeout. By default QuakeLink accepts HTTP
    requests which are queued until the requested data are available. That
    could be forever. If being ran behind a proxy it might be useful to
    configure a timeout at QuakeLink to return an empty document rather than
    receiving a timeout error (504) from the proxy.

    ```
      # Set long polling timeout to 60 seconds
      QL.http.timeout = 60
    ```

-   SUMMARY/2 request format providing access to author information as well as
    individual evaluation mode and evaluation status

-   Use SQlite 3.31.1
-   Increase API version to 2

## 2019-12-02

### Added

-   Config option `QL.enableKeepAlive`. By default clients need to request keep
    alive messages up on connection. Set this flag to true to enable the
    sending of keep alive messages for the native QuakeLink protocol by
    default.

## 2019-09-20

### Added
